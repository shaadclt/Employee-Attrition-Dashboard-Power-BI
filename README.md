## Introduction

The Employee Attrition Dashboard project utilizes Power BI, a powerful business intelligence tool, to create an interactive dashboard for analyzing employee attrition. By connecting to a data source containing employee data, this dashboard enables visual exploration of attrition trends and provides insights into the factors influencing employee turnover.

## Features

The Employee Attrition Dashboard includes the following features:

- **Attrition Overview**: Provides an overview of attrition statistics, including attrition rate, total employees, and attrition trends over time.
- **Employee Demographics**: Visualizes the distribution of employees by demographics, such as age, gender, and department, to identify patterns related to attrition.
- **Attrition Analysis**: Analyzes attrition based on various factors, such as job level, education, and performance rating, to understand their impact on employee turnover.
- **Retention Strategies**: Offers insights into potential retention strategies by identifying factors associated with higher attrition rates, such as low salary or lack of growth opportunities.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Utilizes predictive models to forecast attrition trends and identify employees at higher risk of leaving the organization.
